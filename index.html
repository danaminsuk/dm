<p>Hello loved ones. It's happening! We're getting married on September 25, 2021 and we can't wait for you to celebrate with us. You can find details and updates about the wedding on this page.</p><br>

<p><b>Schedule</b></p>

<p><em>Friday, September 24th</em><br>
Please join us for welcome drinks at one of our favorite NYC spots, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Old+Town+Bar/@40.7376111,-73.9891583,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x47fed87e18b07624!8m2!3d40.7376111!4d-73.9891583">Old Town Bar</a>. There will be an open bar and snacks from 7pm-9pm.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, September 25th, The Big Day</em><br>
We'll be getting married in the neighborhood where Dana grew up in Old Greenwich, CT. The ceremony will start at 5pm at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Uncas+Point+Beach/@41.0134457,-73.5660288,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c298d65860b865:0x4f8d996877af647f!8m2!3d41.0128751!4d-73.567346">Lucas Point Beach</a> and the reception will follow, across the street at the neighborhood dockyard.<p>

<p><em>Sunday, September 26th</em><br>
If you're staying the night in CT, come back to Lucas Point Beach on Sunday morning for bagels and coffee from OG's finest, <a href="http://uppercrustbagel.com/">Upper Crust Bagels</a> (lol). Bring a bathing suit and towel and hang at the beach if the weather is nice. If you're coming for breakfast, please carpool to help with the limited parking situation.</p><br>


<p><b>Transportation</b></p>

<p>You won't be able to park in the neighborhood. We'll arrange for buses to pick you up at one of three locations: the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Old+Greenwich/@41.0333439,-73.5679188,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xd9a7a7858a90ff4b!8m2!3d41.0333439!4d-73.5679188">Old Greenwich Metro North Station</a> (New Haven-bound side), the <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/connecticut/hyatt-regency-greenwich/gwich">Hyatt Hotel</a>, or the <a href="https://www.jhousegreenwich.com/">J House Hotel</a>. If you need a place to leave your car during the wedding, the Old Greenwich train station is the best option. 
We'll update you with the exact times for bus pick up closer to the wedding, but it will likely be around 4pm. Buses will also be available from the wedding, stopping back at both hotels and the train station starting at 9pm and until the end of the party at 10pm. </p><br>


<p><b>Registry</b></p>
<p>You can find our registry here.</p><br>

<p>That's all folks! We can't wait to be all together. Please let us know if you need help navigating where to stay/transportation. We'll update with bus schedules and suggested train timing as we get closer to September.</p>
