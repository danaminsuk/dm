<p>Hello loved ones. It's happening! We're getting married on <b>September 25, 2021</b> and we can't wait for you to celebrate with us. You can find details and updates about the wedding on this page. If you have any questions on the day of the wedding, you can contact our wedding planner, Maggie, at 860-262-2789</p><br>

<p><b>SCHEDULE</b></p>

<p><em>Friday, September 24th</em><br>
Please join us for welcome drinks at one of our favorite New York bars, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Old+Town+Bar/@40.7376111,-73.9891583,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x47fed87e18b07624!8m2!3d40.7376111!4d-73.9891583">Old Town Bar</a>. There will be an open bar and snacks from 8pm until 11pm.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, September 25th, "The Big Day"</em><br>
We'll be getting married in the neighborhood where Dana grew up, in Old Greenwich, CT. The ceremony will start at 4:30pm at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Uncas+Point+Beach/@41.0134457,-73.5660288,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c298d65860b865:0x4f8d996877af647f!8m2!3d41.0128751!4d-73.567346">Lucas Point Beach</a> and the reception will follow, across the street at the dockyard.<p>

<p><em>Sunday, September 26th</em><br>
If you're staying the night in CT, come back to Lucas Point Beach on Sunday morning for bagels and coffee from <a href="http://uppercrustbagel.com/">Upper Crust Bagels</a> (lol), from 9am until 11am. Bring a bathing suit and towel and hang at the beach if the weather is nice. If you're coming for breakfast, please carpool to help with the limited parking situation.</p><br>


<p><b>TRANSPORTATION</b></p>

<p>You won't be able to park in the neighborhood on the day of the wedding. We'll arrange for buses to pick you up at one of three locations: the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Old+Greenwich/@41.0333439,-73.5679188,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xd9a7a7858a90ff4b!8m2!3d41.0333439!4d-73.5679188">Old Greenwich Metro North Station</a> (New Haven-bound side), the <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/connecticut/hyatt-regency-greenwich/gwich">Hyatt Hotel</a>, or the <a href="https://www.jhousegreenwich.com/">J House Hotel</a>. If you need a place to leave your car during the wedding, the Old Greenwich train station is the best option.</p>
<p>A bus will pick up guests staying at the Hyatt at 3:40pm. Guests staying at the J House will be picked up at 3:50pm. Stops will be made at the Old Greenwich train station at 4:00pm, 4:05pm, and 4:20pm. There will be return shuttle service to the Hyatt, J House, and train station from 8:30pm until 10:30pm</p>
<p>We recommend that those traveling to the wedding by Metro North take the 2:36pm New Haven-bound train, departing from Grand Central, to Old Greenwich.</p><br>

<p><b>LODGING</b></p>
<p>Aside from the Hyatt and J House, you may be able to find lodging at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Stamford+Marriott+Hotel+%26+Spa/@41.051039,-73.534875,15z/data=!4m8!3m7!1s0x0:0xfbc56dbf54a1b18!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d41.051039!4d-73.534875">Marriott in Stamford</a> or the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Delamar+Greenwich+Harbor/@41.0179361,-73.6236306,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x6e0b6164a87221d5?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiY3d7NvcXyAhUNh-AKHXKTBO4Q_BIwFnoECEoQBQ">Delamar in Greenwich</a>. If you choose one of these options, you will need to drive or take the train to the Old Greenwich Metro North Station, from which you can catch one of our shuttles to the venue.</p><br>
